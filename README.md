### Weak signals of Immune selection in mixed primary tumor cohorts

### Immune escape abrogates CD8 T cell mediated immune selection

### Immune-escaped tumours show immune-neutral dN/dS and high tumour immunogenicity

### Immune-escaped tumours have better response to immunotherapy than immune-edited tumours

### Immune dN/dS and TMB are associated with overall survival and response in Melanoma patients treated with Nivolumab
